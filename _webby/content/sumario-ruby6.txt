# Ruby gives you three levels of protection:
##  public - methods can be called by everyone. A class's instance methods are public by default.
##  protected - methods can be invoked only by objects of the defining class and its subclasses.
##  private - methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver - the receiver is always self. This means that private methods can be called only in the context of the current object. The initialize method is always private.
# Access control is determined dynamically, as the program runs, not statically. You will get an access violation only when the code attempts to execute the restricted method.
# Top-level methods are private instance methods of the Kernel module.
# attr_reader is reader only; attr_writer is writer only and attr_accessor is both reader and writer.
# An exception is a special kind of object, an instance of the class Exception or a descendant of that class.
# The raise method is from the Kernel module. By default, raise creates an exception of the RuntimeError class. To raise an exception of a specific class, you can pass in the class name as an argument to raise.
# To do exception handling, we enclose the code that could raise an exception in a begin-end block and use one or more rescue clauses to tell Ruby the types of exceptions we want to handle.
# It is to be noted that the body of a method definition is an implicit begin-end block; the begin is omitted, and the entire body of the method is subject to exception handling, ending with the end of the method.
# If you write a rescue clause with no parameter list, the parameter defaults to StandardError.
# If you need the guarantee that some processing is done at the end of a block of code, regardless of whether an exception was raised then the ensure clause can be used. ensure goes after the last rescue clause and contains a chunk of code that will always be executed as the block terminates. The ensure block will always run.
# By default, the inspect message, which can be sent to any object, formats the object's ID and instance variables. It returns a string containing a human-readable representation of object. If not overridden, uses the to_s method to generate the string.
# The Time class contains Ruby's interface to the set of time libraries written in C.
# Time zero for Ruby is the first second GMT of January 1, 1970.
# Ruby's DateTime class is superior to Time for astronomical and historical applications, but you can use Time for most everyday programs.
