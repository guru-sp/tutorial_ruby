A Ruby constant is like a variable, except that its value is supposed to remain constant for the duration of the program. The Ruby interpreter does not actually enforce the constancy of constants, but it does issue a warning if a program changes the value of a constant (as shown in this trivial example) - p054constwarn.rb

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  # p054constwarn.rb
  A_CONST = 10
  A_CONST = 20
<% end -%>


Produces a warning:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  p054constwarn.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant A_CONST
<% end -%>


Lexically, the names of constants look like the names of local variables, except that they begin with a capital letter. By convention, most constants are written in all uppercase with underscores to separate words, LIKE_THIS. Ruby class and module names are also constants, but they are conventionally written using initial capital letters and camel case, LikeThis.

Note that constants do not exist until a value is actually assigned to them.

Although constants should not be changed, you can modify the internal states of the objects they reference, as seen in p055constalter.rb

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  # p055constalter.rb
  A_CONST = "Doshi"
  B_CONST = A_CONST
  A_CONST[0] = "J" # alter string referenced by constant
  puts A_CONST # displays Joshi
  puts B_CONST # also displays Joshi
<% end -%>

<div class='box'>
IN RAILS: You can find examples of this kind of operation (modify) in the Rails source code, where constants figure prominently and the objects they represent undergo fairly frequent changes.
</div>

Note:

    * Constants defined within a class or module may be accessed anywhere within the class or module.
    * Outside the class or module, they may be accessed using the scope operator, :: prefixed by an expression that returns the appropriate class or module.
    * Constants defined outside any class or module may be accessed as it is or by using the scope operator with no prefix.
    * Constants may not be defined in methods.
    * Constants may be added to existing classes and modules from the outside by using the class or module name and the scope operator before the constant name.

The program p056const.rb shows all of this:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  OUTER_CONST = 99

  class Const
      def get_const
        CONST
      end
      CONST = OUTER_CONST + 1
  end

  puts Const.new.get_const
  puts Const::CONST
  puts ::OUTER_CONST
  puts Const::NEW_CONST = 123
<% end -%>


Another elaborate example on own methods in a class is p057mymethods2.rb In this example we shall also see how to write a class method.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  # p057mymethods2.rb
  # variables and methods start lowercase
  $glob = 5 # global variables start with $
  class TestVar # class name constant, start uppercase
   @@cla = 6 # class variables start with @@
   CONST_VAL = 7 # constant style, all caps, underscore
   def initialize(x) # constructor
    @inst = x # instance variables start with @
    @@cla += 1 # each object shares @@cla
   end
   def self.cla # class method, getter
    @@cla
   end
   def self.cla=(y) # class method, setter, also TestVar.
    @@cla = y
   end
   def inst # instance method, getter
    @inst
   end
   def inst=(i) # instance method, setter
    @inst = i
   end
  end
  puts $glob
  test = TestVar.new(3) # calls constructor
  puts TestVar.cla # calls getter
  puts test.inspect # gives object ID and instance vars
  TestVar.cla = 4 # calls setter
  test.inst=8 # calls setter
  puts TestVar.cla
  puts test.inst # calls getter
  other = TestVar.new(17)
  puts other.inspect
  puts TestVar.cla
<% end -%>

I have listed down all the important points you need to remember after you have completed the following topics: Object Serialization, Modules/Mixins, Self, Constants.
