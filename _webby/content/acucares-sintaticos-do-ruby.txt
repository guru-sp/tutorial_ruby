Programmers use the term syntactic sugar to refer to special rules that let you write your code in a way that doesn't correspond to the normal rules but that is easier to remember how to do and looks better.

Let us say we want to set the name of a dog. As a starting point, name can be set along with everything else at object creation time, as in the example below.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  class NewDog
    def initialize(breed, name)
      @breed = breed
      @name = name
    end
    attr_reader :breed, :name   # create reader only
  end
  nd = NewDog.new('Doberman', 'Benzy')
  puts nd.name
<% end -%>


Let's write a set_name method that allows us to set, or reset, the name of an existing dog. We'll also rewrite the initialize method so that it doesn't expect a name:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  class NewDog
    def initialize(breed)
      @breed = breed
    end
    attr_reader :breed, :name   # create reader only
    # setter method
    def set_name(nm)
      @name = nm
    end
  end
  nd = NewDog.new('Doberman')
  nd.set_name('Benzy')
  puts nd.name
<% end -%>


Ruby allows you to define methods that end with an equal sign (=). Let's replace set_name with a method called name=

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  def name=(nm)
    @name = nm
  end
<% end -%>


name= does exactly what set_name did, and in spite of the slightly odd method name, you can call it just like any other method:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  nd.name=('Benzy')
<% end -%>


Here's the modified example - p050newdog.rb

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  class NewDog
    def initialize(breed)
      @breed = breed
    end
    attr_reader :breed, :name # create reader only

    # setter method
    def name=(nm)
      @name = nm
    end
  end

  nd = NewDog.new('Doberman')
  #nd.name=('Benzy')
  nd.name = 'Benzy'
  puts nd.name
<% end -%>


The equal sign gives you that familiar "assigning a value to something" feeling, so you know you're dealing with a setter method. It still looks odd, but Ruby takes care of that, too.

Ruby gives you some syntactic sugar for calling setter methods. Instead of this:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  nd.name=('Benzy')
<% end -%>


you're allowed to do this:

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  nd.name = 'Benzy'
<% end -%>

When the interpreter sees the message "name" followed by " =", it automatically ignores the space before equal sign and reads the single message "name=" - a call to the method whose name is name=, which we've defined. As for the right-hand side: parentheses are optional on single arguments to methods, so you can just put 'Benzy' there and it will be picked up as the argument to the name= method.
