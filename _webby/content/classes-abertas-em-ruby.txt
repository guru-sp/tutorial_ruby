 In Ruby, classes are never closed: you can always add methods to an existing class. This applies to the classes you write as well as the standard, built-in classes. All you have to do is open up a class definition for an existing class, and the new contents you specify will be added to whatever's there.
</div>

Now to the program p031motorcycletest.rb in the last topic, add the method dispAttr

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  require 'p030motorcycle'
  m = MotorCycle.new('Yamaha', 'red')
  m.startEngine

  class MotorCycle
    def dispAttr
      puts 'Color of MotorCycle is ' + @color
      puts 'Make  of MotorCycle is ' + @make
    end
  end
  m.dispAttr
  m.startEngine
  puts self.class
  puts self
<% end -%>


Please note that self.class refers to Object and self refers to an object called main of class Object.

One more example is program - p031xdognext.rb

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  require 'p029dog'
  # define class Dog
  class Dog
    def big_bark
      puts 'Woof! Woof!'
    end
  end
  # make an object
  d = Dog.new('Labrador', 'Benzy')
  d.bark
  d.big_bark
  d.display
<% end -%>

Here's another example of adding a method to the String class. The program p032mystring.rb illustrates the same.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
  class String
    def writesize
      self.size
    end
  end
  size_writer = "Tell me my size!"
  puts size_writer.writesize
<% end -%>

(You can confirm the output to the above programs yourself).

<div class='box'>
If you're writing a new method that conceptually belongs in the original class, you can reopen the class and append your method to the class definition. You should only do this if your method is generally useful, and you're sure it won't conflict with a method defined by some library you include in the future. If your method isn't generally useful, or you don't want to take the risk of modifying a class after its initial creation, create a subclass of the original class. The subclass can override its parent's methods, or add new ones. This is safer because the original class, and any code that depended on it, is unaffected.
